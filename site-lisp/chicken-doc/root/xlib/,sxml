(section 3 "Documentation" (p "This extension provides a low-level binding to the functionality offered by Xlib, the programming interface to the X window system. This library uses the same names as their C counterparts, but function names are converted to lowercase and symbolic constants are uppercase. Only minimal error checking is done. Pointer arguments are generally not checked. Arguments that are specified as C-POINTER also accept #f (false) and treat it as the NULL pointer. What follows is only a list of all exported identifiers, for more information consult a proper Xlib manual.")
