Savvy Emacs users might have noticed that the [Quack] option variable " (tt "quack-tabs-are-evil-p") " defaults to true.  Note also that " (tt "quack-tidy") " gladly slays any tab in sight, laughing maniacally as only the truly righteous can.  Sadly, not all strings in the universe are Scheme code subject to the wrath of Quack, therefore...") (p "This very simple Scheme library provides procedures for expanding tab characters.  It was written early one Sunday morning to complement the plethora of PLT-specific solutions being offered to the problem on the nascent Schematics cookbook Wiki.  Its source code is a bit verbose, but it tries not to generate much garbage, it supports non-zero starting columns, and it should work with any R5RS Scheme implementation that supports [SRFI-6].  (A future edition of this continuing epic might remove the dependency on SRFI-6, should we bother to benchmark and find that some implementations are not as efficient as we'd like.)")
