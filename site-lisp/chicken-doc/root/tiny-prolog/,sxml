(p (tt "new-database!") " sets up a fresh PROLOG database (thereby deleting any existing one).") (p (tt "fact!") " adds a new fact to the database.") (p (tt "predicate!") " adds a predicate with the head " (tt "LIST1") " and the clauses " (tt "LIST2 ... ") " to the database.") (p (tt "query") " attempts to prove " (tt "LIST1") ". It returns a list of results. An empty list indicates that " (tt "LIST1") " could not be proven.") (p "The following macros add some syntactic sugar for interactive use; they allows the user to write, for instance, " (tt "(! (man socrates))") " instead of " (tt "(fact! '(man socrates))") ".")
