((tags "eggs" "graphics" "postscript") (toc) (section 2 "fps" (section 3 "Introduction" (p "FPS is a portable system for doing device-independent, resolution-independent graphics from Scheme programs. It is PostScript, with the Forth computational engine replaced with Scheme.") (p "FPS is tightly based upon PostScript. It uses *exactly* the PostScript base rendering primitives. For example, it understands PostScript AFM files, and can render text using general PostScript fonts.") (p "The design of FPS centers on two basic data structures: paths and pictures.  A path is an invisible, ideal geometric path on a plane. A picture is a description of ink on paper. Paths can be scaled, rotated, translated, and composed, creating new paths. Filling or stroking a path creates a picture. Pictures can also be scaled, rotated, translated, clipped, recolored, and composed, creating new pictures. The system is fully functional and free of side effects. The single side effect available to the user is rendering a picture to an output device. PostScript fonts are supported for generating paths and pictures from text.") (p "The system is not a \"toy.\" The full set of PostScript rendering primitives are provided: lines, curve, arcs, glyphs, and bitmaps. Full control is provided of the rendering engine's style parameters, such as line width, and cap style. Interchangeable RGB, CMYK, and HSB color models are provided.") (p "The current release of FPS renders pictures to any Scheme port as a stream of straight-line, DSC-compliant PostScript text which can be submitted to any PostScript printer or viewed with ghostview. The renderer can generate EPS text if desired. The actual rendering is done on the printer, for accuracy and efficiency (the system has been carefully designed to allow for this phase-distinction between picture construction and rendering).") (p "The current release has at least three lacunae: we do not currently support PostScript patterned fills, text kerning, or huge, CID fonts (such as Chinese).")
